Step 4: Check each string have "-" this symbol if there again split .After splitting the character strings are numeric type convert to int , if there is no numeric type print Invalid type input, Checking array size is 2  is valid length, otherwise invalid length. if valid length again check in list already have this number ,if not there add.
 
Step 5: If not present in this symbol "-" ,again check character strings are numeric type convert to int , if there is no numeric type print Invalid type input, if numeric number again check in list already have this number ,if not there add.
